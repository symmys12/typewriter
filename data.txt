I <strong>just</strong> don't see the point in trying anymore; everything feels like it's too much effort.
I feel so disconnected from everyone around me, like I'm on the outside looking in.
No matter how much I sleep, I always feel tired and drained.
It's like there's this heavy weight on my chest that won't go away, making it hard to breathe.
I used to enjoy these activities, but now I just can't find the energy or interest to do them.
I feel so alone, even when I'm surrounded by people.
It seems like my thoughts are trapped in this endless loop of negativity, and I can't break free.
Why can't I just snap out of this? It feels like there's something fundamentally wrong with me.
Some days, it's a struggle to even get out of bed.
I find myself pretending to be okay because I don't want to burden anyone with how I really feel.
It feels like I'm fading away, and soon there'll be nothing left of me.
The future just seems bleak and empty, like there's nothing to look forward to.
I keep asking myself, 'Is this all there is to life?' because it feels like I'm missing something crucial.
Sometimes, I'm just numb, and I don't feel anything at all.
I'm constantly worried that people will realize I'm not as put together as I seem.
Everything feels overwhelming, like I'm drowning in my own life.
I keep wondering if the pain I feel will ever go away or if this is just how it's going to be.
I miss feeling passionate about something, anything. Now it's like all the color has drained from the world.
It's hard to talk to anyone about this; I feel like they just wouldn't understand.
I've lost interest in things I used to love, and I don't know how to get that back.
Some days, the thought of facing the world is just too much to bear.
I feel guilty for feeling this way when there are so many people who have it worse than me.
It seems like I'm always faking a smile, wearing a mask so no one sees the real me.
Why do I feel so empty when I have so much to be grateful for?
I'm scared that this is how I'm going to feel for the rest of my life.
The silence at night is the worst; it's when all my thoughts start to spiral out of control.
I feel like I've lost myself, and I don't know how to find who I used to be.
It's exhausting trying to keep up appearances when inside I'm falling apart.
I wish I could just disappear for a while, escape from everything and everyone.
I feel like I'm stuck in this dark hole, and every time I try to climb out, I just slip further down.
